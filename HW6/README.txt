### instruction for running my hw6 code ####
first you want to call setmainpath(folderpath)
ex : setmainpath('C:/Users/rgerr/Documents/MachineLearning/')

second you can call any of the functions listed with the specificed inputs

    ### Machine Learning applications ###
# options for letter input = 's','b','c'
# options for f input = 'y','n'
# options for prep = 's','n'
# these are the only input options you can plug in #

regress(letter, f, prep)
SVML(letter, f, prep)
SVMR(letter, f, prep)
SVMP(letter, f, prep)

the returned array is in this format
[[accuracy,MSE,C]
[accuracy,MSE,C]
[accuracy,MSE,C]
[accuracy,MSE,C]
[accuracy,MSE,C]]

and for problem 3 the auc and f1 score and plot are generated by calling

# call this like the previous function but with only 'c' in the letter position #
# the other input options should work like t = 'y','n' & prep = 's','n' #

computeROC(letter, t, prep)

this should show a plot in the plot window and the other values returned are in this form
(Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
